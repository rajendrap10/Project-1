Hi

This is a FSJS Live Class Project 1 Repo. This task taught me a lot of new things, including how to create websites using HTML and CSS. I know a few contemporary HTML and CSS properties.

I would like to say Thankyou my instructor `Hitesh Choudhary` for the guiding, mentoring and pushing me hard so that I can learn and develop this project.
